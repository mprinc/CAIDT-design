\*\* NEED THE STORY BEHIND SLIDES BELOW**

  

https://www.figma.com/file/R05ogPnWgQRqu4jErhEIbD/CAIDT_Michelle%2FMatt?node-id=0%3A1

  

WHAT is "behind" a component, why it is there, what is the purpose of it, how it is related to others. We need a use-case, functional specification, story, and the best person, I believe, is you so to go through each slide and write about it.

  

If you can NARRATE for each, WHAT HOW WHY,

S1

+ Create ... ?

 + why question mark at the end of the title

\*\*\* \+ shouldn't be... pls remove!***

S2

+   \*\*PROBLEM\*\*: missing "Access your existing project"

+ yes- good catch!*

 + "Join a Community Project" is different

+   \*\*PROBLEM\*\*: What about clonning existing?

\*\+ this would be where you enter the code to an existing project. (see wireframes)

\*\+ based on this, there should be an option to clone exsiting as well?*

S1

+   \*\*SUGGESTION\*\*: Would make more sense to move it on the page, AFTER the project is generated

\*\+ agree - makese sense*

  

\## 03_Discover

  

>   \*\*WHAT\*\* \- The discover section identifies who created or is creating this project - and who or what it's for. (potential people affected by this). In this section, the user also identifies the project and/or design question. People should be able to comment on or change the question. Oftentimes people start with the different worldviews and assumptions, we are identifying those here. Additionally, having people identify their community as an option is helfpul (for the open community ones).>

  

>   \*\*HOW\*\* You enter in text to identify who you are - and who you are designing for.

>   \*\*WHY\*\*

> This is important becuase oftentimes these systems are crated by those who are not affected by them.

\## 04_Blueprint

  

>   \*\*WHAT\*\* \- The info from discover carries over into the header. This section is divided into concept inference (how it works), and concept traning.

> While there will not be actual training - the user is learning how to think about AI (or any other tech).

  

>   \*\*HOW\*\* For the concept section, tier 1 looks at how it functions. Tier 2 is used to prime someone to think about a dataset, before choosing a dataset.

>   \*\*WHY\*\*

> It is a big leap to just start develping something. The larger goal behind this is to start with what is known or understandable, and to see examples from the dropdown or other project.

Unclear what this is

\*can you describe which part is unclear?\*

  

+ where it says target audience, maker info, and project description, that all carries over from when it was originally made. it looks like a list and that's confusing. I also realized that there is no edit sign, but as people continue to make - they should be able to click and edit - or go back and edit- whatever is easiest.

  

\## 05.5_Blueprint

  

> please lmk if the above answered your questions.

> This is the feature which does not show the concept map (from the orignal doc - example of what I use with students to orient them to AI)

\## 05_Blueprint1

  

> in this example, the concept map is triggered. If you look in the orignal shared drive you can see an example I use in my classes (I think it's the same here)

\## 06.5_Blueprint-2,5

>   \*\*WHAT\*\* \- This is an example of someone viewing, or choosing an input.>

  

>   \*\*HOW\*\* you can create your own card or choose a lens - there is also a filter option to the right

>   \*\*WHY\*\*

> We do not want to have a hierarchy to inputs, we want to prompt people already contributed inputs, and make a space for people to enter their own.

\## 06_Blueprint-2

>   >   \*\*WHAT\*\* example of pre-filter state, and how to design functionalitly, form, data source,s mld model an dform affect.

>   \*\*HOW\*\* Note: The interaction of adding, selecting cards for functionality, form , data sources, ml model and Form Affect will follow th same interaction as shown here (generalize this approach to the information listed above)

> Note: On the backend all the cards title , contibutors and descriptions are indexed. If the user enter a query text that matches any of the titles, contributors or appears in any description, the result will show those cards.

\## 07_Blueprint-3

here the user adds their info.

they are engaged in their own naming and description. They also identify and contributors and references.

  

There is a save button here but it might be easier to have 1 save button for the whole chunk.

  

Additioanlly, users can upload their images. Over time we'd like to use DL to analyze what concepts are associated with what images.

\## 08_Blueprint-4

  

On clicking the card flips and shpws the description title and contributors

  

eg: user defines RULES, when it is implemented. The RUKES in old design is broken into FUNCTIONALITY and ML MODELS

  

This is a final view before the user goes to cultural lenses. Need to rename cultural lenses to lenses.

\## 09\_UPDATED\_\_\_CulturalLenses

  

Here is the standard question for people to ask regarding lenses. We need to have these here, or people can just skip through it. The idea is that people can add or upvote questions. The top three questions will be displayed.

\## 10_CulturalLenses1

  

> Lenses can be grouped into categories with similar concepts. Create a new lens within a pre-existing or new cateogry.

> 

> WHAT: prompts with lenses (maybe 50% most used and 50% not as used)

> HOW:

> WHY:this can get people to see what other users consider to be important, as well as what people are contributing.

\## 12_CulturalLenses3

> WHAT: this prompts the user/s to create their own lenses. bc the whole point of the tool is to crowdsrouce how people do and want to design these sytems, this gives them a place to make thier own perspective.

>

\## 13_CulturalLenses4

> WHAT: at this point, the user locks in the lenses

> HOW:this means they are considering the following lenses in their design. they do this with the lick in the lenses button

> WHY: so there is accountability in how people are considering the design

>

\## 14.5_CulturalLenses5

> WHAT: This is the PROJECT Drawer that summerises the whole project. This is a last chance to review - after you've changed, and gives you a chance to change your project to reflect these considerations.

\## 15_CulturalLenses-flattening-option

> WHAT: This takes something like principles (for example feminist.ai principles and takes the whole list (if clicked on - and can flatten out each one. For example if you were interested in principle 2, you could click on that)

  

<img   alt="15_CulturalLenses-flattening-option"   src="https://colabo.space/data/projects/CAIDT/wireframes/15_CulturalLenses-flattening-option.png"   height="300px"/>

  

\## 16_Scaffolding

> WHAT: In the scaffolding section, the user identifies the tools currently available wihtin the design tool. this then triggers different datasets (certain tools can only work with certain datasets, models, etc)

  

> this asks - What Software you want to use for Prototyping

> 

> Given your selection, there might be some limitations on the type of inputs, functionality, form, data, models and form affects.

  

>Review your Ai design and check for applicable options for the software

>

>This is where the user or team identifies their data set (the dataset that can be used with the tool or any software they are implementing it with)

  

> HOW:

> 

> WHY:

\## 17_Scaffolding 3

>

Then, for example this: the coment gives a bit of light, but unclear, for example, how a user can edit a lens, if it is basically sealed entity, you can just add or remove it, but not "EDIT" (unless that is a user-created lens, which is a border case), and again, HOW that should be done, WHERE it should go, etc, etc.

  

So this is just an example, WHY WE NEED THE STORY BEHIND SLIDES, why they are not enough.

  

>the lenses may have been locked in, however they might not be able to implement some of the changes or suggestes due to the limitations of the prototying tools - this gives them an opportunity to change those lenses....

>

> WHAT: when you click review, this is the project door that opens

\## 18_Implementation

> WHAT: here the user can search or crate their own data. depending on what tool they used, their options might be limited. for example if they choose runway ml - it really depends on the model, what data options are avialble to them - we have a rough idea bout the model from the concept inference above.

  

>If this is an issue, we can flip the model with the data section in implementaiton. Might be helpfulf or the runway ml use case.

> WHAT: This is where you upload your data.

> This is wher we collect and display information from Scaffolding and user profile to attach the meta data to the data.

> 

  

>This data is reflected on the fork tree if this user agrees to donate his data. So if some other user searches for data repos, this repo appears and on the fork tree this users info will be reflected.

\## 22_ImplementationModelSerch

>choose a model (we might have to move this before the data).

>compare the models - this is a little bit more complex and is a key feature to the project. Indvidiuals should be able to compare how the model has changed.or how this model with different inputs changes. this depends on wheter its running locally or remotely as well as other factors. right now, we can design a wizard of oz, but a main point of the tool is to compare outcomes based on different inputs and lenses and models.

>

>please consider the following notes from the wireframes:

>

>If you select a model that is not supported on th software selcted at the scaffolding stage the system will throw an error in a modal asking them to find a different model

>

>The Search is indexed on the Models and the Data repo, allowing users to search for either by Model name or by Date repo name. (folks can compare different data types with same model - releavnt to cultural lenses.)

>

>After selecting the model here, user can run the inferance. The infarence opens in a modal shown in next screen

>

>This would open the Project Drawer on the top and users can edit the cards to match the model they compare here

>

> explorer "This is disabled till the model is selected "

Additional features proposed:

Integration with Arduino (need to discuss)

Integration with Materials Library

Identification of materials and histories

Integration with Unity

(at the very least - reference this in the desgin as next steps or upcoming)
